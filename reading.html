        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <h3>Programming Design System</h3>
        <blockquote>There is a century-long bod between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant. We now have the ability to write code that produces beautiful designs, and the designer of tomorrow will have to understand how to deliver on that promise. <br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">I really love what the author said in the preface, “There is a need for educational material that teaches the fundamentals of graphic design in a modern way, especially if it also gives students mental models for critiquing digital design projects.” With the emerging technology, the information could be mediated into different forms such as the website, digital phone and even augmented reality. The graphic design is mingled with other subjects like creative coding and interactive programming. The sophisticated system make it difficult to focus on one aspect like the graphic layout here. But the interface based on the aesthetic principle  is still important even when we do the generative art. <br></div>
        <blockquote>Design systems are especially interesting today, because digital products are systems, and designers who code are no longer confined to the creation of design systems that end up in printed manuals. Code allows designers to not just create designs, but build digital systems that create designs.<br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">It is interesting to see how the p5.js using code as a system to describe how to draw. Compared with others, the system of code is to set a series of drawing rules to create design. If we can call design as systems, the code can be also called a system of systems. Besides, the article especially in the chapter of “figure and ground”, I feel it pretty interesting to see the relationship between the shape and perception. I never think about how the graphic design can be trained in that way. By only playing with the size, place and rotation, you could decide the perception or feelings that you want to convey by your visual language. <br><br></div>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <h3>You Look Like a Thing and I love you<br>Chapter 7: Unfortunate shortcuts <br></h3>
        <blockquote>Many of the most tempting problems to solve with AI are also problems prone to issues of class imbalance.<br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">In the article the example of tench mentioned is very very interesting. The principle of artificial intelligence to recognize the images is still unknown to us which also let me rethink about the effectiveness of AI techniques. Besides, this also inspires my thinking about the imbalance about data. Sometimes science can be also subjective because of the training data which may convey the bias and discrimination. <br></div>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <h3>Notes on Failure<br></h3>
        <blockquote>Why certain individuals appear to devote their lives to the phenomenon of interpreting experience in terms of structure, and of language, must remain a mystery. It is not an alternative to life, still less an escape from life, it is life : yet overlaid with a peculiar sort of luminosity, as if one were, and ere not, fully inhabiting the resent tense.<br><br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">The paragraph let me have a better understanding of the dialectic of failure and success. Sometimes failure is a disruptive way to compose things. Success only indicates that the current state is running smoothly. But the failure could be any type by which people can rethink the whole system and the process. This also reminds me of the process of creative prototyping. Sometimes it even doesn’t work after every components made up together.<br></div>

        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <h3>Thinking in Systems<br></h3>
        <blockquote>If you compare Figure 41 with Figure 38, where price was held constant, you can see that the main effect frisking price is to build the capital stock higher before it collapse.<br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">Human try to get away from the natural constraints, so when we look at the stocks now, virtual currency like bitcoin instead of oil. That also reminds me of diamonds (the value of diamonds is given by the businessman). When people becomes the only role in the game, does it mean the system is more stable or more complicated. (Instability of human mind)  <br></div>
        <blockquote>The trick, as with all the behavioral possibilities of complex systems, is to recognize what structures contain which latent behaviors, and what conditions release those behaviors—and, where possible, to arrange the structures and conditions to reduce the probability of destructive behaviors to encourage the possibility of beneficial ones.<br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">Is it possible to predict the trend? The system can be seen as a equation and is determined by the coefficients of variables which is controlled by different elements such as environment, human... (But environment and human are impacted each other meanwhile). Is it possible to find the most optimized answer for the equilibrium? For me it is impossible because of unstable human and nature. <br><br></div>

        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <h3>Synthetic Aesthetic<br>Chapter 3: Design as the machines come to life<br></h3>
        <blockquote>According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 75% of crop genetic diversity has been lost worldwide since the beginning of the twentieth century, as agriculture has become increasingly industrialized. Framers have abandoned local variants for “genetically uniform, high-yielding varieties.<br></blockquote>
        <div class="tb1">This comment is pretty interesting. We always talk about if the genetically modified food are edible in my genetics class. Actually human start to modify plants in order to gain more products or prevent insects. The differences is that our ancestor didn&#x27;t deploy in the aspect of genes. (Playing with genes breaks the boundary of &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;human-made&quot;)<br></div>
